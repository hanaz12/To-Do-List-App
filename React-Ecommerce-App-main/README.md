# React Ecommerce App

## About

This **Ecommerce App** is built using **React JS** and **Redux** to provide state management.
It utilizes **Fetch API** to retrieve data from a dummy JSON server to simulate a full-fledged ecommerce platform.
The app allows users to browse through products, add them to the cart, and manage their cart items seamlessly.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Fetch and display products dynamically from a dummy JSON API.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about each product.
- **Add to Cart**: Add products to the cart and manage cart items using Redux.
- **Cart Management**: Update, remove, and view the total price of products in the cart.
- **State Management**: Implemented using Redux for predictable state management across the application.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**: Front-end framework for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management library to handle global state.
- **Fetch API**: To retrieve product data from a dummy JSON server.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring a responsive design.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
